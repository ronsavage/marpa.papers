<h1>Marpa's Advantages</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Index</a></p>

<p>Of course, the heading means advantages over other methods of parsing.</p>

<p>So - the advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is available as a linkable library</p></li>
<li><p>It is written in C for speed</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa parses in times considered theoretically optimal</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa parses all classes of grammar in practical use today in linear time, O(n)</p></li>
<li><p>Grammars can be ambiguous</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This means Marpa can tell you how many different ways there are of interpreting the input stream.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marpa supports grammars having nullable symbols</p></li>
<li><p>Rules can be recursive</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Try that with a regexp!</p>

<ul>
<li>Your grammar can be described in an extended version of BNF</li>
</ul>

<p>This means you provide the rules as text, not as code. Marpa provides the code to implement these rules.
That is, Marpa generates a parser tailored to your BNF.</p>

<p>This is declarative parsing.</p>

<p>Rules have an optional <em>action</em> adverb, indicating where Marpa is to trigger your callback to handle intermediate results.</p>

<p>This provides an exceptionally clean interface between the rules and any code you need to handle specific cases.</p>

<p>You action subs can communicate with each other via a 'per-parse argument', which is passed to each action sub as
its first parameter. This per-parse argument defaults to an empty hashref. For Marpa, it is read-only:
It is reserved for the exclusive use of your code.</p>

<p>This Marpa-specific BNF is called SLIF-DSL (Scanless Interface Domain-Specific Language).</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa lexes the input stream</li>
</ul>

<p>This means you do not have to provide a separate lexer.</p>

<p>In special cases you can of course take over the lexing yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa is extensively documented</li>
</ul>

<p>For that, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">start here</a>.</p>

<p>And, the author has a <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">Marpa-oriented blog</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa can pause parsing at any place in the input stream, hand control over to you, then resume parsing at any
place in the input stream</li>
</ul>

<p>This is procedural parsing.</p>

<p>Consequently, you can freely switch back and forth between declarative and procedural parsing.</p>

<p>Rules have an optional <em>pause</em> adverb, indicating where Marpa is to return to your calling code, until such time as you
call resume(). This is not the same as the callback trigger mechanism mentioned above.</p>

<p>During the pause, a set of methods allows you to interrogate Marpa about the current state of the parse.</p>

<p>It also means you can parse the next part of the input stream yourself, and tell Marpa to skip what you've handled.</p>

<ul>
<li>Error reporting can provide the precise location of an error</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the string just preceeding and just following the error can be retrieved, as well as a list of the tokens
Marpa was expecting to see at that point.</p>

<p>Even better, Marpa can tell you which rule(s) it was evaluating.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa allows you to fabricate input, using its knowledge of what was expected when it errored</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2011/11/marpa-and-the-ruby-slippers.html">Ruby Slippers parsing</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rules can have an <em>event</em> adverb</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules can share events via their (event) name.</p>

<p>Events can be activated and deactivated.</p>

<p>The current status of each event can be interrogated by your code during a pause.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Marpa has built-in tracing facilities</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa has a 'thin' interface, for direct access to libmarpa</p></li>
<li><p>Marpa prunes all nulled subtrees back to their topmost nulled node</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In Marpa parses, rules and symbols can be nulled. In other words they can derive the zero-length, or null, string.</p>

<ul>
<li>Further, you can short-circuit evaluation during any <em>action</em> sub</li>
</ul>

<p>See 'Bailing out of parse evaluation' in the docs for
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Semantics">the Marpa::R2::Semantics</a> package.</p>

<p>(Recall from <a href="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a>, Marpa has 3 phases: Grammar pre-processing; Recognition; and Evaluation.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa changes the way we think about parsing</li>
</ul>

<p>This automatically leads us to greatly expand what problems now fit the definition of 'parseable'.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marpa has many other advantages, but we have to stop somewhere</li>
</ul>
