<h1>Advanced Usage</h1>

<h2>Conditional preservation of whitespace</h2>

<p>We're all familiar with code which declares a single- or double-quoted string, and expects any whitespace within
that string to be preserved, while at the same time expecting redundant whitespace in the source code to be
discarded. This means we can format the source in different ways, and still have specific whitespace preserved because
it's protected by those quotes. This much is simple.</p>

<p>Well, this is precisely what I mean by <em>conditional</em> preservation of whitespace: Some is preserved and some is
discarded. So, how do we do that using Marpa?</p>

<p>One way would be to have Marpa preserve all whitespace, and commit ourselves to processing it somehow. Here, I'm
going to ignore that option, since there's now a rather more sophisticated way to do it.</p>

<p>A stand-alone Perl module, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MarpaX-Demo-StringParser">MarpaX::Demo::StringParser</a>,
was written to showcase the material discussed here, and to give you something to play with.</p>

<h2>Some context this chapter</h2>

<p>There is a wonderful graphics package called <a href="http://graphviz.org">Graphviz</a>, from AT&amp;T. People have written
various wrappers for Graphviz. Mine is
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Graph-Easy-Marpa">Graph::Easy::Marpa</a>. The module mentioned above,
MarpaX::Demo::StringParser, is a cut-down version of Graph::Easy::Marpa. both these modules implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_languages">Little Language</a> whose purpose is to make it easy for users to
create short text files which are converted by these modules into a form suitable for inputting into programs
(such as <em>dot</em>) which ship with Graphviz. And yes, the wrappers implemented by these modules are another example
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain-specific Languages</a>, just like Marpa's SLIF-DSL.</p>

<p>The grammar in the chapter is taken from MarpaX::Demo::StringParser, and describes nodes, edges, and their
attributes. See <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs">the Graphviz docs</a> for details of these items.</p>

<h2>A sub-grammar for whitespace</h2>

<p>Firstly, here's a tiny fragment of that module's grammar, in Marpa's SLIF-DSL:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>source       =&gt; \(&lt;&lt;'END_OF_SOURCE'),
    ...
:discard     ~ whitespace
whitespace   ~ [\s]+

END_OF_SOURCE
</code></pre>

<p>The entire grammar is a reference to a string of rules, whose oddish delimiters are (&lt;&lt;'END_OF_SOURCE') and
END_OF_SOURCE. The '...' just means the body of the rule set has been suppressed for the moment.</p>

<p>But, see those 2 rules which mention the reserved pseudo-symbol <em>:discard</em> and the token <em>whitespace</em>?
This is Marpa's way of allowing us to say: Discard <em>all</em> whitespace by default. That token <em>whitespace</em> could
have been called <em>ws</em>, or anything similar. That is, it is not a reserved word.</p>

<p>For more on <em>:discard</em>, <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL#Discard-rules">see here</a>. And note,
of course, that these 2 rules are optional. Or, you may wish to discard different characters.</p>

<p>In other words, we're choosing to order Marpa to discard whitespace. Since this conflicts with our stated aim of
preserving <em>some</em> whitespace, we need a mechanism which allows us to tell Marpa to override this default under
circumstances chosen by us. Enter the <em>event</em> and <em>pause</em> adverbs.</p>

<h2>A grammar for nodes in a graph</h2>

<p>Here's a bit more of the grammar, given that nodes are declared using the regexp (regular expression)
/^[.*]$/:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>node_name   ::= start_node end_node

:lexeme     ~ start_node   pause =&gt; before   event =&gt; start_node
start_node  ~ '['

:lexeme     ~ end_node
end_node    ~ ']'
</code></pre>

<p>I'll explain below why the rule called <em>node_name</em> contains no reference to content (input stream text)
between any occurances of the delimiters '[' and ']'. See the next section
<a href="#a_word">A Word on Strings and Invisibility</a>.</p>

<p><em>Pause</em> allows us to specify that at certain locations within the parse, i.e. at certain locations within the
input stream, we want Marpa to stop parsing <em>for a while</em>, and pass control of the parsing process over to us.</p>

<p>It's that <em>for a while</em> part that makes the <em>pause</em> adverb appropriate. After a while, i.e. whenever we feel
like it, we simply tell Marpa to resume parsing. This resumption does not have to take place, and will normally
not take place, at the point the <em>pause</em> was triggered.</p>

<p>And, during that pause, we handle all parsing, and preserve whitespace <em>if we wish</em>. Hence the word
<em>conditional</em> used above.</p>

<p><em>Event</em> allows us to name <em>pause</em>s, and to query Marpa as to which event triggered any particular pause.</p>

<p><a name="a_word"></a></p>

<h2>A word on strings and invisibility</h2>

<p>Don't get confused by these 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>The syntax for a node</li>
</ul>

<p>For my application, the regexp a node must match is /^[.*]$/.</p>

<p>The name of the node is within those '[' and ']' chars.</p>

<p>The name of the node matches /.*/, meaning it can be zero-length as it happens, but you (the reader)
should not attach any significance to the length.</p>

<ul>
<li>The syntax for the node's grammar</li>
</ul>

<p>The grammar a node must match is 'node_name ::= start_node end_node ...', as above, where start_node is '['
and end_node is ']'.</p>

<p>The grammar for the node says Marpa is only allowed to see the '[' and the ']'. The node's name is hidden from Marpa
by the design of the grammar, which forces processing to switch into the code I've written to handle processing
between those 2 tokens.</p>

<p>This makes the node's name invisible to Marpa, and explains why the grammar ('...start_node end_node...') says
that - as far as Marpa is concerned - there is literally nothing between the '[' and the ']'.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://savage.net.au/Ron/html/stringparser.grammar.svg">an SVG version</a> of the full grammar implemented
by MarpaX::Demo::StringParser. The display of the <em>node_name</em> component is at the bottom-left (7 pm position) of
the graph.</p>

<h2>An intermediate summary</h2>

<p>We've actually touched on a number of topics already, ofter interrelated ones, so here's a list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ways to handle whitespace</p>

<p>In short, these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preserve all whitespace by default</li>
</ul>

<p>I.e. Design a grammar where whitespace is never discarded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Preserve some whitespace</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, preserve whitespace by default, while overriding that sometimes, by using <em>pause</em>, to handle the
precise way whitespace is <em>conditionally</em> discarded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discard all whitespace by default</li>
</ul>

<p>I.e. Design a grammar where whitespace is always discarded.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discard some whitespace</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, discard whitespace by default, while overriding that sometimes, by using <em>pause</em>, to handle the
precise way whitespace is <em>conditionally</em> preserved.</p>

<p>This last mechanism is the topic of this article.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-symbols such as <em>:discard</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These allow us to specify <em>static</em> aspects of how we want Marpa to act.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adverbs such as <em>event</em></li>
</ul>

<p>These allow us to name <em>pause</em>s, and to query Marpa as to which event triggered any particular pause.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adverbs such as <em>pause</em></li>
</ul>

<p>These allow us to specify <em>dynamic</em> aspects of how our code interacts with the parsing process.</p>

<p>Other languages implement the command (verb) <em>yield</em>, which transfers the flow of control back and forth in a
vaguely similar fashion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting Marpa to resume parsing after the callback</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we control the manner in which Marpa resumes. We do this by moving the offset within the input stream at
which Marpa resumes.</p>

<p>Clearly this could involve moving that pointer backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>Since this determines the next token Marpa sees, it thus directly controls the next rule triggered. Naturally that
could be the same rule as the last one triggered.</p>

<p>In this article, I'll always be moving it forwards, I assure you!</p>

<p>The direct implication of all this (i.e. the grammar fragment above) is that I am saying these 4 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tell Marpa I accept responsibility for processing a certain subset of the input stream</li>
</ul>

<p>This is specified in the grammar, using <em>pause</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I respond when Marpa tells me it's reached such a point</li>
</ul>

<p>This is part of my code, where I check for which <em>event</em> triggered the <em>pause</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I finish processing that part of the input stream</li>
</ul>

<p>So I return control back to Marpa. And then ...</p>

<ul>
<li>I tell Marpa to treat that subset as invisible, and to resume parsing after it</li>
</ul>

<p>This happens because I tell Marpa whereabouts within the input stream to resume at when I next call
<em>sub resume()</em>. And I do that with the call <em>resume($pos)</em>. See line 20 of the code in the section
<a href="#pause">Handling the pause on the Perl side of things</a>.</p>

<p>Neat, huh?</p>

Since I've called them graphs, that means each line below is a complete input stream. Further, all sample lines
below can be combined into a single file, shipped as data/graph.04.ge within the distro.</p>

<h2>The full grammar of MarpaX::Demo::StringParser</h2>

<p>Before discussing the Perl code for handling pauses, I want to mention a trap in grammar design.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>You might be tempted to change the edge stuff from this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>41    edge_name              ::= directed_edge
42                               | undirected_edge
43
44    :lexeme                ~ directed_edge      pause =&gt; before        event =&gt; directed_edge
45    directed_edge          ~ '-&gt;'
46
47    :lexeme                ~ undirected_edge    pause =&gt; before        event =&gt; undirected_edge
48    undirected_edge        ~ '--'
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>41    edge_name              ::= directed_edge
42                               | undirected_edge
43
44    directed_edge          ::= '-&gt;'   action =&gt; edge
45
46    undirected_edge        ::= '--'   action =&gt; edge
</code></pre>

<p>It certainly looks simpler, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Then, your Perl would not need to contain code to handle those 2 pauses, since Marpa would just trigger
calls to the action <em>sub edge()</em>.</p>

<p>Don't do that!</p>

<p>What happens is that <em>sub edge()</em> is now called at a different time in the flow of processing than it is with
the original grammar.</p>

<p>Recall this from Chapter 1: "... by the time the first action is executed, the last event is ancient
history."</p>

<p>Thus: Any call to <em>sub edge()</em> is made after all the calls to <em>pause</em>-related code.</p>

<p>And now it's time to <em>pause</em> ...</p>

<p><a name="pause"></a></p>

<h2>Handling the pause on the Perl side of things</h2>

<p>Item 1: The process as whole</p>

<p>If Marpa is going to yield processing, we need to explicitly code for this.</p>

<p>BTW, a grammar without any <em>pause</em>s can process a string in one hit:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>my($string) = 'Input stream...';
my($result) = $recognizer -&gt; read(\$string);
...
</code></pre>

<p>To handle <em>pause</em>s however, we switch to a loop, since we must call <em>sub resume()</em> after each pause, until Marpa
hits the end of the input stream.</p>

<p>So, here is the <em>sub process()</em> method of MarpaX::Demo::StringParser:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>01    sub process
02    {
03        my($self)   = @_;
04        my($string) = $self -&gt; graph_text;
05        my($length) = length $string;
06
07        # We use read()/lexeme_read()/resume() because we pause at each lexeme.
08
09        my($attribute_list);
10        my($do_lexeme_read);
11        my(@event, $event_name);
12        my($lexeme_name, $lexeme);
13        my($node_name);

<p>Item 2: Lines 16 .. 21 - The Loop</p>

<p>Lines 16 .. 21 are saying that since we put at least one <em>pause</em> in the grammar, we must expect Marpa to exit from
<em>sub read()</em> before the end of the input stream, and that we must immediately:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handle the pause</li>
</ul>

<p>That's lines 25 .. 76.</p>

<ul>
<li>Handle the fact that Marpa paused <em>before</em> the lexeme declaring the <em>pause</em></li>
</ul>

<p>That's lines 41, 56 and 78, which tell Marpa to move past the lexeme with <em>sub lexeme_read()</em>
(discarding it in the process). Then, at the top of the loop, we call <em>sub resume()</em>.</p>

<p>So, we just have to explain lines 25 .. 76.</p>

<p>And 78 actually, since the call to <em>sub lexeme_read()</em> is dependent on something via the <em>$do_lexeme_read</em> variable.</p>

<p>Item 3: Lines 25 .. 76 - The Context and The Code</p>

<p>Here we stockpile values for use below:</p>

<p>Line 25: $do_lexeme_read = 1</p>

<p>We set a flag so that by default we read and hence skip the lexeme where Marpa paused. See line 78.</p>

<p>We reset this flag in some cases, as explained next. See lines 44 and 59.</p>

<p>The structure of this particular grammar has a feature you might not be using: Each <em>pause</em> is at the start of a
<em>pair</em> of delimiters. That is, the expected input includes '[ ... ]' and '{ ... }'.</p>

<p>So, the code now has to do 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Skip the lexeme Marpa paused at, i.e. the opening delimiter</li>
</ul>

<p>And that's the first token of each pair, '[' or '{'. This is easy, since Marpa tells us where it paused.</p>

<p>See the calls to <em>sub lexeme_read()</em> at lines 41 and 56.</p>

<p>But, and it's a huge but, in these 2 cases we can't use the <em>sub lexeme_read()</em> at line 78, because we need its
return value, <em>$pos</em>, at lines 43, 58 and, later, 20.</p>

<p>Hence we call <em>sub lexeme_read()</em> at lines 41 and 56, <em>and</em> we use <em>$do_lexeme_read</em> to disable the call at
line 78.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 2: Skip the lexeme which is the closing delimiter of each pair</li>
</ul>

<p>That's just the closing ']' or '}'. But this just happens automatically when we return to the top of the loop.</p>

<p>Well, not quite automatically. The calls to <em>sub find_terminator()</em>, at lines 42 and 57, do what the method name
says, and also return <em>$pos</em>, which we use in lines 43 and 58 (discussed below), and which we pass back to
Marpa at line 20 when we call <em>sub resume()</em>.</p>

<p>This ties in with the grammar, lines 29 .. 30 and 59 .. 60, where we do <em>not</em> specify any pause for the closing
delimiters, so Marpa just continues right on past them.</p>

<p>Item 4: Line 26: @event = @{$self -> recce -> events}</p>

<p>... and ...</p>

<p>Item 5: Line 27: $event_name = ${$event[0]}[0]</p>

<p>We ask Marpa which <em>event</em> triggered the <em>pause</em>.</p>

<p>That allows us to handle each case in the multi-branched 'if' starting at line 35.</p>

<p>Since the 'if's do simple string comparisons, there is no gain from using a smart-match module such as
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/match::simple">match::simple</a>.</p>

<p>Item 6: Line 28: ($start, $span) = $self -> recce -> pause_span()</p>

<p>This tells us the offset within the input stream at which Marpa paused. So, we use this as the starting point
for our scan of the input, looking for the closing delimiter matching the opening one found by Marpa.</p>

<p>See lines 42 and 57.</p>

<p>Item 7: Line 29: $lexeme_name = $self -> recce -> pause_lexeme()</p>

<p>This tells us the name of lexeme at which Marpa paused. We use it to tell Marpa to step over it before resuming.</p>

<p>See lines 41, 56, and, for the other cases, 78.</p>

<p>Item 8: Line 30: $lexeme = $self -> recce -> literal($start, $span)</p>

<p>This is the string we need in those cases where we don't need to search between delimiters for our text.</p>

<p>We just pass this to the <em>sub edge()</em>, to be pushed on to a stack of interesting things.</p>

<p>See lines 67 and 71, and the matching grammar at lines 44 .. 48.</p>

<p>Item 9: Line 42: $pos = $self -> find_terminator(\$string, qr/}/, $start);</p>

<p>... and ...</p>

<p>Item 10: Line 57: $pos = $self -> find_terminator(\$string, qr/]/, $start);</p>

<p>These set <em>$pos</em>, i.e. the offset within the input stream, to the closing delimiter matching the opening one
found by Marpa (as stated just above).</p>

<p>We do this because back at the top of the loop, <em>$pos</em> is passed to <em>sub resume()</em>, telling Marpa where exactly
we want it to resume parsing.</p>

<p>Item 11: Line 43: $attribute_list = substr($string, $start + 1, $pos - $start - 1)</p>

<p>... and ...</p>

<p>Item 12: Line 48: $self -> attribute_list($attribute_list)</p>

<p>These, together with the matching pair, lines 58 and 63, preserve all our work by pushing the list of attributes
on to the stack mentioned above.</p>

<h2>A final summary</h2>

<p>The stack built is due to Marpa pausing, and then we call subs directly, rather than have Marpa call <em>action</em> subs.</p>

<p>All this must take place in a choreographed manner, so that the calls to those subs are in the correct
chronological order.</p>

<p>This order (at least for my app, and I'm sure for any typical app) must correspond exactly to the order in
which Marpa detects tokens of interest.</p>

<p>And this order is of course the order in which those tokens appear in the input stream.</p>

<h2>Some general notes about the code</h2>

<p>It's not obvious from the code shown, but <em>sub process()</em> is called (from <em>sub run()</em>) within a
try ... catch structure, handled by the fine module <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Try::Tiny">Try::Tiny</a>.</p>

<p>When <em>sub process()</em> exits successfully, the stack is analyzed in various ways.</p>

<p>Firstly, it's printed in a formatted manner if that's what the user asked for.</p>

<p>Secondly, also optionally, it's written to a CSV file for further processing at the user's leisure.</p>

<h2>Finally</h2>

<p>I hope I've made it easier to approach the dread topic of lexing and parsing. The simple fact is that with
Marpa's new SLIF we can pass over to Marpa almost all the work, and just write code to handle precisely targeted
places of interest within the input stream.</p>

<p>Overall, this should make clear the astonishing power of Marpa to relieve the programmer of what in
the past was a huge component of such work.</p>

<p>This is combined with an almost-always clean interface, allowing our code to interact with Marpa neatly and
efficiently.</p>
